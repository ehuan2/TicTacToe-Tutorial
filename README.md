# TicTacToe-Tutorial
A TicTacToe game completed.

Essentially, we will be looking at teaching if statements, loops, arrays and methods through learning the logic behind the checkWin() statement in the class TicButton (found from src file).

To play the final result, simply go to the out folder, then the artifacts folder, then download the JAR file. From here on out, simply open the JAR file, and you can play!

The first opening requires you to enter a number, tells you how big the board will be. Simply enter 3, that is the classic size, and the best to teach how to use if statements.
